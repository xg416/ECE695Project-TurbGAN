This project is based on the paper [TurbuGAN: An Adversarial Learning Approach to Spatially-Varying Multiframe Blind Deconvolution
with Applications to Imaging Through Turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06764)
However, the implementation is not the same as the paper, details can be found in the slides and pdf file.
